            <p>
              The Crossrope app is the digital companion to Crossrope's weighted
              jump ropes. Rich in features and content, it offers users a
              variety of ways to work out, track their progress, and stay
              motivated.
            </p>
            <p>
              I transformed the previously overwhelming app experience into one
              that's clean, personalized, and intuitive through research,
              testing, iterative design, and post-launch refinements.

                The Crossrope app was overwhelming, impersonal, and had outgrown
                its navigation system.

                  Survey data revealed users' top home screen priorities:

                  I explored a variety of concepts and did rounds of internal
                  review and iteration, during which I proposed and ultimately
                  abandoned several potential ideas. <br />

                  Balancing priorities: Early and continuous input from

            We analyzed feedback from user interviews, surveys, and analytics,

          <h4>Overwhelming</h4>

            Users reported feeling overwhelmed by the amount of options and busy

              The primary tab would be heavily focused on the user, displaying
              their stats first and foremost, while still offering some quick
              workout options.

              <p>
                There was enough engagement with the workout content in the
                existing primary tab that it was too risky to remove it in favor
                of additional stats. Plus, building out the components for all
                of those new stats would have required a level of development
                effort that was out of scope.

                The last mockup above shows how the design began to evolve back
                toward including more workout content rather than a variety of
                user stats.

              Circular progress bars dominate digital fitness experiences
              because they're satisfying to complete and offer a key benefit
              lacking in horizontal progress bars: showing progress that exceeds
              100%. This would have been valuable as it's common for users to
              surpass their goals.

            <p>
              I tried many different variations of this concept, but no matter
              how I designed it, team members felt that the 'mini-goal' idea was
              confusing. The design just didn't have the same impact when it was
              for the monthly goal as a whole, since the incremental progress
              wouldn't be visible like it would be with daily goals.

                  The first tester wanted "quick links" on the Home screen, and
                  I realized that the old segment control had value, it just
                  needed to be improved. The solution: a fresh new button bar
                  that reorders dynamically based on user activity.

                <p>
                  <span class="semibold green900">Moving the Button Bar:</span>
                  I initially placed the button bar below the top three sections
                  so it would be accessible, but not distracting. Testing
                  revealed that users would prefer it at the top. I broke a
                  familiar pattern, and users helped me see that it wasn't an
                  upgrade.

          <h4>Nav Buttons for Key Features</h4>
          <div class="group-paragraphs below-h3-h4">
            <p>
              In the old design, the top nav bar contained 3 buttons: AMP,
              Stats, and Profile. In the new design, there was only room for 2
              buttons. I initially kept AMP and Profile buttons, removing Stats.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
              'AMP' refers to Crossrope's AMP Handles, which are Bluetooth
              connected jump rope handles. They enable real-time jump counting
              and speed tracking.

                  The process of pairing AMP handles for the first time had to
                  stay seamless, and keeping it in the nav ensured high
                  visibility.

                  The new Stats cell on the Home screen opens the Stats page,
                  and there's also a button to open it from the Profile menu.

                  During testing, most users didn't intuitively know to open
                  Stats by tapping on the cell on Home. Plus, all users said
                  they would prioritize the Stats button over the AMP button.

                  I tested a version with no visible AMP symbol, and some users
                  struggled to find it in the profile menu. I added an AMP icon
                  next to the Profile button, serving as an access point and
                  status indicator.

            Survey results, user feedback, and analytics validated that the
            redesign massively improved the app experience. Users told us the

            <span class="semibold">more personalized and intuitive</span>. We

          <p class="below-h3-h4">
            Though the release was a huge success, there is always room for
            improvement. About six months after the release, we had plenty of
            analytics data and user interview feedback to inform our decisions
            about what to improve and how.
          </p>
          <h4>The Button Bar</h4>
          <div class="h5-block single">

              <p>
                <span class="semibold green900">Unexpected Trends:</span>
                We thought the button bar would be the primary navigation
                method, but analytics revealed the opposite: most users were
                using the Jump tab to navigate to workout modes.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="semibold green900">Understanding Why:</span>
                I did some interviews and asked users to show me what they do
                when they open the app. I watched user after user ignore the
                button bar and open the Jump tab, confirming what our data
                showed. Most users couldn't explain why, and some said they
                hadn't noticed the button bar at all. This suggested the buttons
                were too small and visually subtle.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="semibold green900">Improvement & Impact:</span>
                After iterating and releasing an updated design that used more
                color and slightly larger buttons, usage of the button bar to
                access the Free Jump feature
                <span class="semibold">increased by 48%</span>, with 40% of
                users now accessing it from the button bar, compared to 27%
                before the change.

                User feedback saying that the Home screen was overwhelming
                decreased substantially after the release, but we still heard it
                from time to time. I conducted a survey in January 2025 that
                showed 20% of respondents still thought it was cluttered and/or
                everything looked too similar.

                I was thrilled to finally get to implement a unified component
                system on the Home screen, as it hadn't been a development
                priority in the past. In my efforts to unify, I had
                overcorrected and made distinct pieces of content look too
                similar to each other. I went back to my designs and made some
                thoughtful tweaks to distinguish different content types and
                create a stronger visual hierarchy.
