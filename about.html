              <h2>The Highlights</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I earned a degree in digital design and spent about two years
                  working as an in-house graphic designer. Going into that
                  position, I was a textbook perfectionist and proud of it.
                  While I still have perfectionistic tendencies, I know better
                  than to embrace them. Now I take pride in my ability to focus
                  on details that matter, meet deadlines, and put aside my idea
                  of "perfect" in favor of solutions that work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  My most recent work experience was teaching
                  <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/alissab_aerial/?hl=en"

                    >aerial/circus fitness.</a
                  >
                  The most valuable thing I took away from this was learning how
                  to adapt to help people with various personalities, learning
                  styles, and limitations reach their goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I received my certification in UI Design through CareerFoundry
                  and did my specialization in Frontend Development. I built
                  this site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Accessibility is important to me. My thinking is: design
                  inclusively or don't design at all! Why bother creating
                  something if you don't care about the people who are going to
                  use it?
                </li>

              <h2>My Story</h2>
              <p>
                I worked as a graphic designer for a product development
                start-up for about two years. I collaborated with other
                designers on various projects, from branding to packaging. I
                also designed presentations that helped the firm land meetings
                with some of the biggest brands in their industry. When I
                started the job, I took pride in being a perfectionist; I now
                consider myself to be in recovery. But, jokes aside, I don't
                take pride in my perfectionism anymore. Instead,
                <span class="regular-weight"
                  >I take pride in my ability to focus on details that matter,
                  meet deadlines, and put aside my idea of "perfect" in favor of
                  solutions that work</span
                >
                for all stakeholders involved.<span id="dots">..</span>
                <span onclick="toggleExpandText()" id="readMore"

              <div id="more">
                <p>
                  I took a detour from design work to do something completely
                  different: teach aerial (circus) fitness. One of the most
                  valuable things about this experience has been training so
                  many different people. I've taught lifelong athletes alongside
                  people who've never stepped foot in a gym. I've worked with
                  kids as young as 5, adults in their 50s, and the whole range
                  in between. I've also coached people who were anxious, even a
                  few that were afraid of heights, and people who jumped in the
                  hoop and got upside down like they'd been doing it forever.
                  <span class="regular-weight"
                    >This massive variety in personalities, learning styles, and
                    limitations forced me to think about my students (or
                    users!), what they need, and how I could adapt my approach
                    to help them reach their goals.</span
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the pandemic hit, I couldn't teach or even practice; I
                  was stuck at home trying to figure out what to do next. I'd
                  been missing design for a while, and this felt like the
                  perfect time to jump back in. I decided to pursue a whole new
                  career by getting certified in UI Design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When my course material mentioned accessibility, I was
                  intrigued. So I did some research to learn more, and I was
                  shocked and outraged by the state of things (if you haven't
                  heard, about
                  <a
                    href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/#wcag"
                    target="_blank"
                  >
                    97% of the top one million websites fail to meet the
                    accessibility standards</a
                  >
                  published by WCAG).
                </p>
                <p>
                  I can't fix the whole internet by myself, but
                  <span class="regular-weight"
                    >I am committed to doing my part to make the web accessible
                    to all.</span
                  >
                  My journey with inclusive design is a work in progress, and
                  one of my goals is to get certified as an accessibility
                  professional. For now, I try to be mindful of color contrast,
                  input field labels, alternate text for photos, and other
                  essentials from the WCAG guidelines.

                  In my free time, I love to go indoor rock climbing, practice
                  aerial hoop, and make bagels with my wife at our home in
                  Raleigh, NC.
                </p>

                  Whether you read all of that or not, you know one thing about
                  me: I'm long-winded! I love information, and I have a lot to
                  say about the things I'm passionate about. I'd love to chat
                  about inclusive design, aerial arts, or bagel making, so get
                  in touch!
