                  I worked as a graphic designer for two years after getting my

                  While I used to take pride in being a perfectionist, now I
                  take pride in my ability to focus on details that matter, meet
                  deadlines, and put aside my idea of “perfect” in favor of
                  solutions that work for all stakeholders involved.

                <li>
                  My most recent work experience was teaching aerial/circus
                  fitness. The most valuable thing I took away from this was
                  learning how to adapt my approach to help people with various
                  personalities, learning styles, and limitations reach their
                  goals.

                  I got certified in UI Design through CareerFoundry and did my
                  specialization in Frontend Development. I built this site from
                  scratch!

                  I’m passionate about inclusive design and committed to doing
                  my part to make the web accessible to all.

              <h2>My Story</h2>
              <p>
                I worked as a graphic designer for a product development
                start-up for about two years. I collaborated with other
                designers on various projects, from branding to packaging. I
                also designed presentations that helped the firm land meetings
                with some of the biggest brands in their industry. When I
                started the job, I took pride in being a perfectionist; I now
                consider myself to be in recovery. But, jokes aside, I don’t
                take pride in my perfectionism anymore. Instead,
                <span class="regular-weight"
                  >I take pride in my ability to focus on details that matter,
                  meet deadlines, and put aside my idea of “perfect” in favor of
                  solutions that work for all stakeholders involved.</span
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                I took a detour from design work to do something completely
                different: teach aerial (circus) fitness. One of the most
                valuable things about this experience has been training so many
                different people. I’ve taught lifelong athletes alongside people
                who’ve never stepped foot in a gym. I’ve worked with kids as
                young as 5, adults in their 50s, and the whole range in between.
                I’ve also coached people who were anxious, even a few that were
                afraid of heights, and people who jumped in the hoop and got
                upside down like they’d been doing it forever. <span
                  class="regular-weight"
                  >This massive variety in personalities, learning styles, and
                  limitations forced me to think about my students (or users!),
                  what they need, and how I could adapt my approach to help them
                  reach their goals.</span
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                When the pandemic hit, I couldn’t teach or even practice; I was
                stuck at home trying to figure out what to do next. I’d been
                missing design for a while, and this felt like the perfect time
                to jump back in. I decided to pursue a whole new career by
                getting certified in UI Design.
              </p>
              <p>
                When my course material mentioned accessibility, I was
                intrigued. So I did some research to learn more, and I was
                shocked and outraged by the state of things (if you haven’t
                heard, about
                <a
                  href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/#wcag"

                  >97% of the top one million websites fail to meet the
                  accessibility standards</a
                >
                published by WCAG).
              </p>
              <p>
                I can’t fix the whole internet by myself, but
                <span class="regular-weight"
                  >I am committed to doing my part to make the web accessible to
                  all.</span
                >
                My journey with inclusive design is a work in progress, and one
                of my goals is to get certified as an accessibility
                professional. For now, I try to be mindful of color contrast,
                input field labels, alternate text for photos, and other
                essentials from the WCAG guidelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my free time, I love to go indoor rock climbing, practice
                aerial hoop, and make bagels with my wife at our home in
                Raleigh, NC.

                Whether you read all of that or not, you know one thing about
                me: I’m long-winded! I love information, and I have a lot to say
                about the things I’m passionate about. I’d love to chat about
                inclusive design, aerial arts, or bagel making, so get in touch!
