          <!-- OVERVIEW TEXT -->
          <p>
            Hidden Gems is a conceptual app that I created for a course project
            focused on native apps. This project was my first foray into
            Google’s Material Design guidelines and Apple’s Human Interface
            Design guidelines. My goal for this project was to work within each
            set of rules and still execute my vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            The brief was entirely open-ended. After some brainstorming, I
            decided to create an app that would help people shop locally by
            showing them the local spots nearby. Shopping local benefits the
            entire community: consumers enjoy tasty food and unique product
            selections, the local economy gets a boost, and small business
            owners receive support.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary factor that keeps people from shopping local is that
            large chains are easy to find, and local places often aren’t. I
            designed Hidden Gems to bridge this gap by making it easy for people
            to see all of the incredible local spots that are just around the
            corner from them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was the UI/UX designer for this project, so I did everything from
            the initial concept and visual identity to user flows, wireframes,
            final screen layouts, prototyping, and mockups. I worked on the
            project from January through mid-March 2021.

              />
            </picture>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
              When crafting my project proposal, I did research into existing
              apps for finding local businesses. Though there are a few apps
              that offer users a way to find local businesses, I couldn’t find
              any that did exactly what I saw my app doing that have gained much
              traction in the market.
              <a
                href="files/hidden-gems-existing-app-analysis.pdf"
                target="_blank"
                >View my analysis of the existing apps here.</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Separately, I did some UI research and analysis to observe the
              patterns and functionality in successful directory apps. I
              analyzed two main apps: Yelp and FourSquare. My intention for
              Hidden Gems is that it would function very similarly to these
              apps, so I got a lot of valuable information from analyzing them.

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>
              In the beginning UX phase, I created a project proposal in which I
              defined my projected users, listed the essential features and user
              stories, and created user flows and a user flow diagram.

              />
            </picture>
            <p>
              I extracted the list of screens I needed to create from my user
              flows, and then started sketching some low-fidelity wireframes.
            </p>

            <h3>Wireframe</h3>
            <p>
              After creating low-fidelity wireframes, it was time to iterate! I
              added detail as I moved the screens into the mid-fidelity stage,
              and then I used them to create a prototype. I requested feedback
              on the prototype and made improvements based on the input I
              received. It took several more rounds of polishing and tweaking
              before I had the final screens.

            </picture>
            <h3>Visual Language</h3>
            <p>
              Building on the idea of an opulent gem, the visual style for
              Hidden Gems is angular and sleek with a minimal color scheme. The
              mix of bright, almost neon, turquoise with mid-range teals and
              deep emerald greens communicates luxury without being
              unapproachable. For the icon set, I used Material Design icons as
              a base and customized them to have thinner strokes and sharper
              edges.

              />
            </picture>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              I created about 30 screens for each operating system. Though not
              always immediately obvious, there are meaningful differences
              between the screens for iOS and Android. This required me to
              essentially design the app twice, which was a great exercise in
              patience! The screens can be broken into several main categories
              based on function and content:
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="regular-weight">Onboarding:</span> These screens give
              users a brief introduction to the app, plus an opportunity to turn
              on location services and create an account if they want.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="regular-weight">Search:</span> Since searching is the
              primary function of the app, the home screen doubles as the search
              screen. There are multiple places a user can tap to create a
              search - the search bar, the category cards underneath, or the
              image and search suggestion at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="regular-weight">Business listing:</span> The business
              listing screen displays photos, reviews, and basic information
              about the business. Users can save the listing to an existing
              folder or create a new folder by tapping the bookmark icon or the
              floating action button (Android only).
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="regular-weight">Saved Places:</span> Users can save
              places to folders so they can find them easily later. The app
              comes with two default folders: Favorites and Places to Try. Users
              can create custom folders here as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="regular-weight">Account:</span> Since users don’t
              need to sign up to use the app, there is a version of the account
              screen for guest users and a version for logged-in users. The
              guest version gently encourages users to create an account.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also created several empty state screens for when a search
              returns no results, and for when a folder has no saved places yet.

              I created a number of mockups to use throughout my case study. I
              used a mix of iPhone and Android devices to showcase both native
              apps.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Designing my first native app was an exciting challenge. My main
              goal for this project was to follow the OS guidelines and still
              bring my vision to life as much as possible. I achieved this by
              experimenting, running through numerous rounds of feedback and
              iterations, and pushing myself to take my designs right up to the
              edge of the acceptable standards in each OS’s guidelines.
