          <!-- OVERVIEW TEXT -->
          <p>
            This piece is a responsive web app I designed for a course project
            where the brief was to create an online store. Space is a conceptual
            furniture store that offers modern, minimalist home furnishings. The
            problem I was aiming to solve was the frustration of trying to buy
            furniture in physical stores. It takes too much time, and it can be
            challenging for consumers to find what they need. I wanted to build
            a web app that would be incredibly simple to use, with intuitive
            navigation and minimalistic layouts. The ultimate goal of this is to
            make it easier for people to find and buy furniture that they love.
            <br />I was the UI/UX designer for this project. I came up with a
            brand name, designed the logo, and built a complete set of Brand
            Guidelines. I then created user flows and a user flow diagram,
            sketched low-fidelity wireframes, and created digital mid-fidelity
            wireframes. I also did user testing and then built high-fidelity
            screens and mockups. I worked on the project from mid-March through
            mid-May 2021.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
              I started by defining the problem and doing research. I combed
              through furniture sites like Ikea, Wayfair, AllModern, and Rove
              Concepts. I analyzed the UX and UI of the sites and made notes
              about what seemed to work and what didn’t.

            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>
              I chose the name Space to communicate simplicity and spaciousness.
              I designed the logo with the same intent, so it made sense to
              create the letterforms with simple geometric shapes. I also used
              negative space and symmetry to give it a minimal yet eye-catching
              look. My vision for the color palette was neutral tones with teal
              accents applied sparingly for maximum impact. I compiled these and
              other elements into a brand guidelines document.

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>
              Once I had established the brand, I started defining the UX
              foundations of the product. I chose my primary user stories from
              the list included in the brief and ran a task analysis to
              determine what screens I would need.
              <br />Building on this, I created user flows and a user flow
              diagram.
              <a href="files/space-user-flow-diagram.pdf" target="_blank"
                >(View the user stories and user flow diagram here.)</a
              >
              The project parameters required me to choose a single user flow to
              design, so I had to narrow my list of screens down to the
              essentials for that flow. <br />Primary User Story: As a returning
              customer, I want to see my purchase history so that I can easily
              order items from the same collection.

            </picture>
            <p>
              I started sketching and then switched to digital to create
              mid-fidelity wireframes. I sketched out ideas for the mobile
              screens first so I could refine my concepts. Then I sketched the
              other breakpoints as well before transitioning to digital
              wireframes.

            <h3>Wireframe</h3>
            <p>
              Once I finished sketching, I switched to digital to create
              mid-fidelity wireframes. I turned these into an interactive
              prototype and used it to perform usability testing so I could
              catch UX issues early on. After analyzing the feedback I received,
              I refined the mid-fidelity wireframes into high-fidelity. I
              continued to refine with the help of feedback from my mentor until
              I had a set of final high-fidelity screens.

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              In total, I designed 15 screens per breakpoint. Since the project
              brief limited me to just one user flow, I chose to build one that
              includes screens and patterns that I haven’t explored in previous
              projects, like purchase history, shopping cart, and checkout.

            <p>
              I created a set of mockups to show the final screens. I used a
              space/galaxy theme as a play on the brand name. The rich, dark
              colors I used to style the mockups really let the light and airy
              interfaces shine.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Shopping in stores can be pretty overwhelming, and I have to say
              that I much prefer the online experience. I bought my couch and
              ottoman from Amazon and it was incredibly easy! However, shopping
              on websites like Ikea can be just as overwhelming as shopping in
              their stores. I believe I created a product that would serve users
              more effectively by providing a simple, streamlined purchase
              experience.
