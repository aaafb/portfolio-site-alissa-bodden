            <p>
              This piece is a responsive web app I designed for a course project
              where the brief was to create an online store. Space is a
              conceptual furniture store that offers modern, minimalist home
              furnishings. The problem I was aiming to solve was the frustration
              of trying to buy furniture in physical stores. It takes too much
              time, and it can be challenging for consumers to find what they
              need. I wanted to build a web app that would be incredibly simple
              to use, with intuitive navigation and minimalistic layouts. The
              ultimate goal of this is to make it easier for people to find and
              buy furniture that they love.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was the UI/UX designer for this project. I came up with a brand
              name, designed the logo, and built a complete set of Brand
              Guidelines. I then created user flows and a user flow diagram,
              sketched low-fidelity wireframes, and created digital mid-fidelity
              wireframes. I also did user testing and then built high-fidelity
              screens and mockups. I worked on the project from mid-March
              through mid-May 2021.

                I started by defining the problem and doing research. I combed
                through furniture sites like Ikea, Wayfair, AllModern, and Rove
                Concepts. I analyzed the UX and UI of the sites and made notes
                about what seemed to work and what didnâ€™t.

              <p>
                I chose the name Space to communicate simplicity and
                spaciousness. I designed the logo with the same intent, so it
                made sense to create the letterforms with simple geometric
                shapes. I also used negative space and symmetry to give it a
                minimal yet eye-catching look. My vision for the color palette
                was neutral tones with teal accents applied sparingly for
                maximum impact. I compiled these and other elements into a brand
                guidelines document.

              <h3>Ideation</h3>
              <p>
                Once I had established the brand, I started defining the UX
                foundations of the product. I chose my primary user stories from
                the list included in the brief and ran a task analysis to
                determine what screens I would need.
              </p>
              <p>
                Building on this, I created user flows and a user flow diagram.

                  >(View the user stories and user flow diagram.)</a
                >
                The project parameters required me to choose a single user flow
                to design, so I had to narrow my list of screens down to the
                essentials for that flow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Primary User Story: As a returning customer, I want to see my
                purchase history so that I can easily order items from the same
                collection.

              <p>
                I started sketching and then switched to digital to create
                mid-fidelity wireframes. I sketched out ideas for the mobile
                screens first so I could refine my concepts. Then I sketched the
                other breakpoints as well before transitioning to digital
                wireframes.

                Once I finished sketching, I switched to digital to create
                mid-fidelity wireframes. I turned these into an interactive
                prototype and used it to perform usability testing so I could
                catch UX issues early on. After analyzing the feedback I
                received, I refined the mid-fidelity wireframes into
                high-fidelity. I continued to refine with the help of feedback
                from my mentor until I had a set of final high-fidelity screens.

                In total, I designed 15 screens per breakpoint. Since the
                project brief limited me to just one user flow, I chose to build
                one that includes screens and patterns that I havenâ€™t explored
                in previous projects, like purchase history, shopping cart, and
                checkout.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Shopping for furniture in stores can be overwhelming compared to
              shopping online. However, using the websites of corporate giants
              like Ikea can be just as overwhelming as shopping in their stores.
              I created a product that would serve users more effectively by
              providing a simple, streamlined purchase experience.
